SLAM, or Simultaneous Localization and Mapping, is a computational process used to enable robots, drones, and autonomous vehicles to navigate and understand their environment. It involves constructing a map of an unknown area while simultaneously tracking the device's position within that space. SLAM is commonly applied in areas like robotics, augmented reality, and autonomous driving to ensure precise spatial awareness and effective real-time navigation.
